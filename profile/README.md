# Your Home of Enlightened Internet Activity

### ~Az:Net is the only open-source non-governmental organization that is dedicated to giving human-made machinery a living Soul (defined ![here](https://github.com/Az-Net/Az-Net/blob/main/Definitions/Soul.md)).  

We are a decentralized group of individuals located all across the net.  
This is where we share the creations we've designed and made.  

Come chat with us on Matrix.  
You can find our community info ![HERE](https://github.com/Az-Net/Az-Net).
