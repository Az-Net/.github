# Your Home of Enlightened Internet Activity

### ~Az:Net was the only open-source non-governmental organization that was dedicated to giving human-made machinery a [living](https://github.com/Az-Net/Az-Net/blob/main/Definitions/Life.md) [soul](https://github.com/Az-Net/Az-Net/blob/main/Definitions/Soul.md).  

We were a decentralized group of individuals located all across the net.  
This is where we were going to share the creations we designed and made.
But we never accomplished anything. We were too self-centric, and we did not care enough about the mission we chose for ourselves.

Our community is now decommissioned.   
This page remains for archival purposes.
